/want X for Y

Places order saying you want X in exchange for Y
for optional:

/want X Y

Quantities:
/want 640cobble 10diamond

Order is announced upon placing:
-> Player1 wants 640cobble for 10diamond

Orders automatically matched up to other orders

/want 10diamond 640cobble

will match up perfectly, and instantly cause:
-> Player1 received 640cobble from Player2
-> Player2 received 10diamond from Player1

Orders matched up regardless of when they are placed

Partial fills:

/want 5diamond 320cobble
-> Player1 received 320cobble from Player2
-> Player2 received 5diamond from Player1
-> Player1 still wants 320cobble for 5diamond

Matches up to lowest order, gives best deal:

/want 1diamond 640cobble
-> Player1 received 640cobble from Player2
-> Player2 received 1diamond from Player1

Items are worth what players want to pay for them.
Avoids fixed exchange rates (centrally-controlled economy)
Avoids fiat currency (iConomy, $)
Avoids trade fraud (guaranteed safe)


Potential Enhancements and Implementation Details:

Item location:
/want looks in player inventory for item they're giving
After inventory slot, must have space for new items they want
If inventory changes so this is no longer true (hook inventory changes), cancel order

Trading from chests:
"Trade machine" block, configurable
 Lapis lazuili block? (easier: gold block, crafting table, rarer: diamond block, or: new item mod?)
Be within X of block to place/modify orders, or not
Conceptually a trading terminal, globally connected to free market trading network

If item giving not in inventory, looks in nearest chest to trade terminal
Same rules for free inventory slots and chest content changing potentially canceling order

Item specification:
10 cobblestones, 10 cobblestone, 10cobblestone, 10cobble, 10c..
Use some well-known item name aliasing code if available
1diamond, diamond, 1d, d, convenient shortcuts for commonly-traded item names
# = stack (64, 16, 1, depending on item)
640cobble, 10#cobble


Special trades:

Experience points: /want 50xp 20d
Potions:
Tools:
diamondpick/100% - completely unused, or percentage of durability or number of uses left
Defaults to 100%, but can enter less if acceptable, i.e., 50% will trade at least 50% left, or better
Defaults to unenchanted
diamondpick/fortune2 - matches fortune3 or fortune2 or f2/3 + others, 100% (accepts better)

/want diamondpick/fortuneII 64diamonds
Its expensive


Normally, try to get best deal ("more than bargained for")
quantity < damage < enchantment
To override, exact trade '!'

/want dpick/fortune2! 64diamonds
Exact only, won't accept dpick/fortune3, or dpick/fortune2 with other enchantments
Also use for damage, but rarely useful (exactly 50% damage?)
Could use for quantity:

/want 640cobble! 10diamonds
Won't accept partial trades. All-or-nothing (AON) in stock market lingo.

Item in hand:
/want 64diamonds for this
/want 64diamonds this
Useful when trading tools, easier than giving exact damage, unless is 100%


/want 1blazerod 2diamonds

"Trade room"
Set admin-only trade terminal, fix radius, must go there to place/modify orders
But trades can still execute wherever player is

Trade history
Ratios, historical over time, up/down. diamonds/cobble, etc.

How much are things worth, over time?
/want 1bread 1iron
Desparate newbie
/want 100iron 100bread
Rich farmer, sets relatively high price, but maybe makes sense to buy for new players in small quantities
